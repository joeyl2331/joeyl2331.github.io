            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about students using what they learned about javascript and the
                tool that they picked from the beginning of the year to make an interactive product. The purpose of this
                blog is for students to record down the process of everything they learned this year to fully understand
                the concept of their tool so that they can successfully create the final interactive project.</p>

            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>For my project, I am making a platformer game where in order for the user to successfully go to the next
                level, they would need to avoid touching the enemy and collect key. This blog will walk through my
                process of independently studying KaboomJs in order to make my platformer game.</p>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>One of my biggest challenges I faced throughout this year is brainstorming ideas of what type of game I
                would be making. It is because before I finalized my decision, I had thought of game options like mario
                and flappy birds. Another challenge I faced is writing the code for the sprite to go through from one
                level to another. It is because for my first few trials, when the player goes to the next level, it will
                appear as an error. However I have fixed the error by putting levels inside the scene. </p>


               <p> A takeaway I have from doing this project is paying attention to the code I am writing and using
                console.log to help me debug code when I am stuck. Asking peers and teachers for help is also a great
                way to understand what you donâ€™t understand better.</p>


                <p>My next steps for this project are to add more levels and to have a scene dedicated to prize selection.
                The player gets to choose their prize depending on the amount of coins they have collected from when
                playing the game. It is because I saw some students (who played our games) collecting all the coins on
                each level for the game. </p>
