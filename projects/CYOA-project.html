            <h1 class="margin text-center">Becoming an A-list celebrity CYOA project</h1>
            <p>For this project, me and my other two partners worked together to create a game, where the choices that you make can depend on how your life will be.  </p>
            <p>This game is about the life of becoming an A-list celebrity. First, you would either choose to wake up when the alarm rings or continue sleeping. This first choice that you make has a huge impact on the next obstacle. If you were to choose to wake up, then you can either choose to practice or to slack off. By practicing, you can have better oppurtunities and can faster acheive your goal of becoming an A-list celebrity. However if you were to slack off and continue sleeping, then you would receive punishments and it furthers you away from achieving your goal of becoming an A-List celebrity. </p>
            <p>Some challenges I had on doing this project was thinking about how we should format the game to be like. Before coming to the final decison, we had a lot of different ideas but they all didn't work out well. It was either the options to choose from are limited or we didn't have enough files. Another challenge was communication. Because of the schedule switch, me and my partner couldn't communicate verbally to finish our project. Therefore we had to think of other ways to communicate, such as messaging each other on Instagram.</p>
