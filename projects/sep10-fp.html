            <h1 class="margin text-center">Year Long Project About Technolgy In Fashion And Apparel</h1>
            <h3>Content/ Context</h3>
            <p>The “Freedom Project”, which is also known as the “year long project” for SEP10 is all about making a website talking about the past and future of a certain topic we are interested in. The purpose of this blog is about the past and future technology in the field of apparel and fashion. For my project, I am making a website about apparel and fashion using HTML, CSS, Github, Bootstrap, and my freedom project tool; Semantic UI. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying fashion and apparel and making the website. 

            </p>   
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> A challenge I had for this year-long project was brainstorming the tool for my future innovation because looking for an invention that has not been already created is not easy. When thinking about my innovation, most of the inventions that I have thought about have already been created so I couldn't use it. Therefore I thought of the idea of combining the hardware tools that I researched into one tool. Another challenge is the presentation. The struggle that I have for the presentation is thinking about what I should do for my hook because I don’t know what can be a good way to start the presentation and grab the audience’s attention. In the end, I managed to come up with a good hook which gives the audience information on how the sewing machine came from and how it was originally created.  

            </p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>A takeaway that I have from this year-long project is how to learn. For this year-long project, we are basically on our own. Researching for the tools and building the website and preparing our presentation. Another takeaway that I have is time management. Learning time management is important because I am able to complete the work on time that is being assigned to me.
